## My Portfolio
Is an active, dynamic website I created using HTML and CSS. It tells a little about my background, demonstrates my skills with HTML and CSS and also is acting as a contact location for future employers and industry folks. This website leverages CSS tools like navbar, form, hover effects and image containers. I hope you like it!

## Cinema Website
This website was created using Bootstrap 4. It is a model of what a movie theatre website would look like: with movie selections, showtimes, and an about section. The Bootstrap components utilized include jumbotron, cards, form, navbar and dropdowns. 

## Garden Website
Lastly, is the website I made that is rendition of a mom-and-pop garden shop. It was created using HTML and CSS, as well. The website utilizes CSS styling like hover, effects, image containers, and form.
