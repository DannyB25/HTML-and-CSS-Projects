# HTML and CSS Projects
Hello! My name is Dan Brion and this is a repository for my Tech Academy HTML and CSS projects. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my evolving understanding of HTML and CSS, exhibit the product of my investment in these areas and, hopefully, help others learn the basics of these languages.
