                        <h3>Early Life</h3>
                        <p><a class="red" href="default.asp">Nielsen was born on 11 February 1926 in Regina, Saskatchewan. His mother, 
                            Mabel Elizabeth (n√©e Davies), was an immigrant from Wales, and his father, 
                            Ingvard Eversen Nielsen (1900-1975), was a Danish-born constable in the Royal
                             Canadian Mounted Police. Nielsen was born the second of two boys to both his
                              parents. His elder brother, Erik Nielsen (1924-2008), was a long-time 
                              Canadian Member of Parliament, cabinet minister, and Deputy Prime Minister 
                              of Canada from 1984 to 1986. He also has a half-brother, Gilbert Nielsen, 
                              from his father's other relationship.</a></p>
